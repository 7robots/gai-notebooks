These generally include:\n","\n","1. **API Architecture and Design Principles**: This involves considering the characteristics your APIs should have to ensure they meet your organizational needs and comply with relevant standards. For example, APIs might need to follow certain documentation standards, especially if they are intended to be used by multiple groups within your organization 【0†api_gateway_portal_standards0_4 copy.pdf】.\n","\n","2. **API Platform Components**: Notably, this includes using an API Portal and an API Gateway. An API portal should support developer onboarding by providing a central source for documentation and making APIs discoverable. An API gateway acts as a single point of entry for APIs. It abstracts complexity and centralizes aspects such as authentication, monitoring, and rate-limiting policies 【9†api_gateway_portal_standards0_4 copy.pdf】.\n","\n","3. **Categorizing APIs**: Different APIs in your organization may have different roles, such as being public, partner-specific, or private, and each category might require different levels of governance, security, and exposure through the API Gateway and Portal.\n","\n","- **Vendor APIs**: Managed either internally or by external partners, need to be treated according to their management and governance requirements 【5†api_gateway_portal_standards0_4 copy.pdf】.\n","  \n","- **Internal APIs**: May serve diverse application needs across the organization and should typically be deployed using an API gateway to comply with security standards. Shared internal APIs should be included in the API portal 【15†api_gateway_portal_standards0_4 copy.pdf】.\n","\n","- **Internal APIs for Specific Applications**: Often used for internal communication and data transfer within a particular application and might not need to be listed in the API gateway or portal, though they must still meet security and monitoring requirements 【17†api_gateway_portal_standards0_4 copy.pdf】.\n","\n","- **APIs with Particular Policy Requirements**: Some internal APIs, while not intended for wide usage, may benefit from policy enforcement services provided by the API gateway, such as stringent throttling and monitoring requirements 【19†api_gateway_portal_standards0_4 copy.pdf】.\n","\n","4. **Best Practices**: These can include using runtime-only mode for production environments, following deployment standards, utilizing a shared infrastructure, building for performance and scale, and creating reusable components. Additionally, you should document API architecture and design principles, provide thorough documentation on API use, and maintain an inventory of your applications and their APIs 【16†apex_advisory_v1.00 copy.pdf】.\n","\n","Regarding the use of an **API Gateway**, knowing how to leverage it effectively is crucial. Key points to understand include:\n","\n","- **Centralization**: An API Gateway centralizes authentication, monitoring, and rate-limiting policies, simplifying the management of these aspects 【7†api_gateway_portal_standards0_4 copy.pdf】.\n","- **Access Control**: The API Gateway often manages access control to the APIs, determining which APIs are exposed and to whom.\n","- **Performance and Scalability**: The API Gateway can handle requests in a manner that ensures performance doesn’t degrade as the number of users or requests increases.\n","- **Security**: The gateway plays a critical role in enforcing security policies to protect your APIs from threats and to ensure compliance with necessary standards.\n","- **Monitoring and Analytics**: It allows for the monitoring of API usage patterns and the collection of analytics that can provide insights into how your APIs are being used.\n","\n","It's essential to evaluate and categorize your APIs within the context of their intended use and the audience to determine the extent to which they should utilize the API Gateway and be included in the API Portal. This will depend on your specific requirements for security, monitoring, scalability, and governance.\n"]}],"source":["import time\n","\n","assistant = client.beta.assistants.retrieve(\"asst_YG1kOyOuM4IpeX46KEvY4LN9\")\n","\n","thread = client.beta.threads.create()\n","\n","\n","message = client.beta.threads.messages.create(\n","    thread_id=thread.id,\n","    role=\"user\",\n","    content=\"I am developing an API.
