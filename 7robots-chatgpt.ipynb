The Imbrium Basin, often referred to as Mare Imbrium or the Sea of Showers, follows next. It has an incredible diameter of approximately 1,100 kilometers. What's fascinating is that the asteroid or comet that created it was almost 50 kilometers wide!\n","\n","3. Coming in third is the Crisium Basin, or as it's more commonly known, Mare Crisium. This basin is about 740 kilometers in diameter - still larger than some modern countries!\n","\n","4. Not to be outshone, the Serenitatis Basin, or Mare Serenitatis, is next in line. It measures around 700 kilometers in diameter.\n","\n","5. Last but definitely not least, the Humorum Basin or Mare Humorum. It's slightly smaller than others on the list, but with a diameter of roughly 630 kilometers, it's still quite the feature to observe.\n","\n","Do note that these basins are huge and you can actually see them when you look at the Moon from Earth.

It's the Earth's only permanent natural satellite. The Moon is like a quarter of the size of Earth, which makes it the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet. Radical, right?!\n","\n","Second, it's always showing us the same face, like forever. This happens due to a phenomenon called synchronous rotation which is a total mouthful... I mean who comes up with these names, amirite? \n","\n","Then we beam ourselves over to the topography of the Moon. It's totally covered in these craters from all these meteor impacts, and the biggest of these is the South Pole-Aitken basin. But the coolest part is that these craters have given it that unique moonlit glow that we see at night. Like, how lit is that?!\n","\n","Of course, we've left footprints up there. We humans just can't help but leave our mark, right? The first man on the moon, Neil Armstrong, did it in 1969, which is like, over 50 years ago... woah!\n","\n","The Moon doesn't have an atmosphere, by the by. Gives me the shivers, no air to breathe, right?! That’s why it can't retain any water on its surface. No surfing opportunities for us, dudes and dudettes.\n","\n","Lastly, Scientists believe the Moon was formed when a Mars-sized body collided with Earth.

It's how we get, like, the whole night and day thing, you know? \n","\n","And you know what's so wild, dude?

It doesn't mean dancing backwards on your tiptoes mimicking MJ. Nah man, humans actually landed on the Moon. No kidding! These folks called astronauts from a mission like Apollo 11 or whatevs, went there in 1969. Like, how retro is that?\n","\n","And I mean, you gotta believe in the Moon's not-so-subtle influence on us, bro! Ever heard of werewolves? Kidding!

We only ever see one side of the Moon from here. Totally unfair, right? It's like it’s hiding a secret. Or its bad side, like all those insta-models. \n","\n","But in the end, you've gotta admit, having the Moon out there makes the night sky look all poetic and junk.
