The Moon is like a quarter of the size of Earth, which makes it the largest natural satellite in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet. Radical, right?!\n","\n","Second, it's always showing us the same face, like forever. This happens due to a phenomenon called synchronous rotation which is a total mouthful... I mean who comes up with these names, amirite? \n","\n","Then we beam ourselves over to the topography of the Moon. It's totally covered in these craters from all these meteor impacts, and the biggest of these is the South Pole-Aitken basin. But the coolest part is that these craters have given it that unique moonlit glow that we see at night. Like, how lit is that?!\n","\n","Of course, we've left footprints up there. We humans just can't help but leave our mark, right? The first man on the moon, Neil Armstrong, did it in 1969, which is like, over 50 years ago... woah!\n","\n","The Moon doesn't have an atmosphere, by the by. Gives me the shivers, no air to breathe, right?! That’s why it can't retain any water on its surface. No surfing opportunities for us, dudes and dudettes.\n","\n","Lastly, Scientists believe the Moon was formed when a Mars-sized body collided with Earth.

It doesn't mean dancing backwards on your tiptoes mimicking MJ. Nah man, humans actually landed on the Moon. No kidding! These folks called astronauts from a mission like Apollo 11 or whatevs, went there in 1969. Like, how retro is that?\n","\n","And I mean, you gotta believe in the Moon's not-so-subtle influence on us, bro! Ever heard of werewolves? Kidding!

We only ever see one side of the Moon from here. Totally unfair, right? It's like it’s hiding a secret. Or its bad side, like all those insta-models. \n","\n","But in the end, you've gotta admit, having the Moon out there makes the night sky look all poetic and junk.

The silence was broken by an uncontrollable fit of laughter from the trio.
